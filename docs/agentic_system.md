### Categorize by step
- single-step
- multi-step

### Categorize by participant
- single-agent
- multi-agent

### Categorize by team size
- Fixed-size team
- Flexible-size team

### Categorize by interaction
- autonomous
- interactive

### Categorize by application
- compute-intensive applications
- retrieval-intensive applications
- generation-intensive applications

### Categorize by complexity
- Simple tasks
- Complex tasks

### Categorize by task type
- Perception-based

## Multi-agent architecture patterns

**Sequential**

**Parallel**

**Loop**

**Hierarchical**

**Networking (Team)**
- Selector + Workers
- Orchestrator + Workers
- Round Robin
- Swarm
- Competition

## Whatâ€™s Happening Around the World?

- Some researchers focus on **benchmarking** (e.g., GAIA, SWBench).
- Others try to **modify agent's behavior** (e.g., ReAct, CodeAct).
- Some try to **improve agent's ability** (improve memory, reasoning, safety, well-aligned, etc.)
- Some study **agent's collaboration** (e.g., MagenticOne, Alita).
- Others work on **delivering agent-related frameworks, platforms, and applications**.
