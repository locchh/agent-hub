## What’s Happening Around the World?

- Some researchers focus on **benchmarking** (e.g., GAIA, SWBench).
- Others try to **modify agent's behavior** (e.g., ReAct, CodeAct).
- Some try to **improve agent's ability** (improve memory, reasoning, safety, well-aligned, etc.)
- Some study **agent's collaboration** (e.g., MagenticOne, Alita).
- Others work on **delivering agent-related frameworks, platforms, and applications**.

## Why Agent-Based Systems Can Be More Powerful than Pure LLMs

- 🔍 Retrieve Accurate Information (Web, Files, APIs, External, Internal, Up-to-Date).

- 🖥️ Execution of Code & Complex Computation in a Secure Sandbox.

- 🛠️ Integration with Specialized Tools (Calculator, Browser, Database, etc.).

- 🤝 Collaboration Between Multiple Agents.

- 🗃️ Long-term, short-term memory.

## Example Queries

### Really Hard Queries
- What are the latest developments in AI safety research?
- If LLM trainings continue to scale up at the current rhythm until 2030, what would be the electric power in GW required to power the biggest training runs by 2030? What does that correspond to, compared to some countries? Please provide a source for any number used.

### Agentic System
- "Book a flight from SFO to JFK next Friday under $300 and add the itinerary to my Google Calendar."
- "Fetch the latest World Bank GDP for Japan, plot the last 5 years, and summarize the trend in 3 bullet points."
- "Compare MacBook Air M2 vs. ThinkPad X1 Carbon (2024) specs, price, and reviews; recommend one with purchase links."

### Software Development
- "In the repository, fix the bug causing `parse_args` to throw TypeError when no flags are provided; add a unit test and open a PR."
- "Resolve Issue #342: memory leak in `ImageCache` during batch processing; write regression tests to cover the fix."
- "Update to `requests>=2.32` and refactor deprecated calls; ensure CI passes on Python 3.11."

### Personal Assistant
- "Schedule a dentist appointment next week between 3–5pm near 10001; confirm by email."
- "Find a 4.5+ star vegan restaurant within 2 miles and book a table for 4 at 7pm Friday."
- "Renew my car registration on the DMV site; walk me through any forms and fees."

### Data Analysis
- "In a spreadsheet, compute monthly spend per category, flag anomalies >2σ, and export a summary CSV."
- "Navigate the retailer’s website to locate the return policy for electronics and start a return for Order #12345."
- "Use the weather API to fetch this week’s forecast and generate a 7-day activity plan with packing checklist."

### Planning and Reasoning
- "If the living-room motion sensor is idle for 5 minutes after sunset, turn off the lights unless ‘Movie Mode’ is active."
- "Plan the sequence to move blocks A, B, C so that A ends on C with minimal moves given stacking constraints."
- "Set a rule: if a stock falls 5% intraday and earnings are not tomorrow, place a stop-loss; otherwise, alert only."

### Research
- "Reproduce Figure 3 from the LoRA paper using the provided seed and report BLEU and training time."
- "Recreate the ablation table on CIFAR-10 comparing optimizers (SGD, AdamW, Lion) with identical budgets."
- "Implement the method section from ‘Paper X’, run on the author’s dataset, and verify metrics within ±1%."

### E-commerce
- "Find a red cotton T‑shirt under $25 in size M, add to cart, and share the cart link."
- "Log into the forum, search for ‘install docker on ubuntu’, upvote the best answer, and bookmark the thread."
- "Navigate a documentation site to download the latest API SDK for Python and verify the checksum."
